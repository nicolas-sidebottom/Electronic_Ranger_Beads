# Electronic_Ranger_Beads
Documentation for the Electronic Ranger Beads project. 

This repository includes images, code, circuit diagrams, and gerber files which were created in the process of this personal design project. The PCB was printed by and purchased from JLCPCB with the majority of circuit components being sourced via the LCSC catalog. The project was originally developed on an Arduino Uno, with the final version being produced with an Arduino Micro and a custom-designed PCB to integrate the circuit cleanly for portability. The battery protection circuit was based off of a similar circuit designed by GreatScott https://www.youtube.com/@greatscottlab. 

The next steps in the project include the printing of a V2 board which includes breakout pins to allow for the easy flashing of updated .ino files for the Arduino, as well as the implimentation of frequency analysis techniques to better process the IMU signal into countable steps, and the design and printing of a custom case.
